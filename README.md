# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

This project explores customer segmentation for credit card users using a real-world dataset. The workflow combines Python for preprocessing, clustering, and model building with R/Shiny for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize business insights.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering).

Customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

Business insights derived from spending, payments, and risk behaviors.

Machine learning models to predict risk scores.

Deployment of an interactive Shiny dashboard for exploration.

Tech Stack

Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

R (Shiny, tidyverse)

GitHub for version control and portfolio showcase

Goals

Provide meaningful segmentation of credit card customers for business strategy.

Demonstrate integration of Python analysis with R Shiny visualization.

Showcase end-to-end workflow from raw dataset to polished insights.
